# T-EP1-001-005: Implement file storage service for product photos

## Title
Implement file storage service for product photos

## Description

Implement IFileStorageService interface with dual storage strategy (local file system for development, cloud storage for production) to handle product photo uploads and management.

**Purpose:**
- Provide unified interface for file storage operations
- Support local development and production cloud storage
- Enable photo upload, retrieval, and deletion for products

**Details:**
- IFileStorageService interface: UploadAsync, DownloadAsync, DeleteAsync, GetUrlAsync
- LocalFileStorageService: Store files in local file system during development
- CloudFileStorageService: Use AWS S3/Azure Blob Storage for production
- Generate unique file names to avoid conflicts
- Support multiple file formats (JPG, PNG)
- Include file validation (size limits, format validation)
- Configuration-based storage selection (appsettings.json)

**References:**
- Architecture: `Documentos/arquitectura.md` (Storage layer)
- Model C4: `Documentos/modelo-c4.md` (Object Storage component)
- User Story: HU-EP1-004 (photo upload requirements)

## Acceptance Criteria
