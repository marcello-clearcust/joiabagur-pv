## Requirements
### Requirement: Return Registration with Sale Association

The system SHALL allow administrators and operators to register product returns by associating them with one or more original sales from the same point of sale within a 30-day window. Returns automatically increment stock and create inventory movement records.

#### Scenario: Create return associated with single sale

- **WHEN** authenticated user (admin or operator) selects product to return
- **AND** selects point of sale (operator: from assigned POS only)
- **AND** system displays eligible sales (same product, same POS, within 30 days, with available quantity)
- **AND** user selects one sale and enters quantity to return (<= available quantity)
- **AND** user selects return category (required)
- **AND** optionally enters reason text
- **AND** optionally attaches photo
- **THEN** system creates Return record with total quantity
- **AND** creates ReturnSale record linking return to sale with quantity and price snapshot
- **AND** creates InventoryMovement record with type "Return" (positive quantity change)
- **AND** updates Inventory.Quantity atomically (increment by returned quantity)
- **AND** returns success with return ID

#### Scenario: Create return associated with multiple sales

- **WHEN** user selects product to return with quantity > available in single sale
- **AND** system shows multiple eligible sales with available quantities
- **AND** user selects multiple sales and distributes return quantity across them
- **AND** total distributed quantity equals requested return quantity
- **AND** each sale's distributed quantity <= that sale's available quantity
- **THEN** system creates Return record with total quantity

- **AND** creates single InventoryMovement with total quantity change
- **AND** returns success

#### Scenario: Partial return from multi-unit sale

- **WHEN** original sale has Quantity = 5
- **AND** user creates return with Quantity = 2
- **THEN** system creates Return with Quantity = 2
- **AND** ReturnSale records quantity = 2 from that sale
- **AND** sale still has 3 units available for future returns
- **AND** stock increments by 2

#### Scenario: Reject return exceeding available quantity

#### Scenario: Add optional reason text

#### Scenario: Create return without reason text

- **WHEN** user creates return without entering reason
- **THEN** Return.Reason is stored as null
- **AND** return is created successfully with category only

### Requirement: Eligible Sales Query

  - Same ProductId
  - Same PointOfSaleId
  - SaleDate within last 30 days
  - Available quantity > 0 (Sale.Quantity - already returned quantity)
- **AND** results include: saleId, saleDate, originalQuantity, availableForReturn, unitPrice, paymentMethod
- **AND** results ordered by SaleDate descending (most recent first)

#### Scenario: Calculate available quantity per sale

- **WHEN** sale has Quantity = 5

- **THEN** availableForReturn = 3
- **AND** sale appears in eligible list with available = 3

#### Scenario: Exclude fully returned sales

- **WHEN** sale has Quantity = 2
- **AND** previous returns have used all 2 units
