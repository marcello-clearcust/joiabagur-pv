## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Client-Side ML Inference

The system SHALL execute machine learning inference in the browser/mobile device using TensorFlow.js, eliminating server-side ML costs and reducing latency for product identification.

#### Scenario: Download model on first use

- **AND** subsequent uses load model from cache (no re-download)

#### Scenario: Load embeddings index on first use

#### Scenario: Check embeddings staleness

- **WHEN** frontend has embeddings index cached in memory

#### Scenario: Manual model update trigger

- **WHEN** operator or admin clicks "Actualizar modelo" button in settings
- **THEN** frontend forces fresh metadata check
- **AND** downloads latest model if newer version exists
- **AND** displays progress: "Descargando modelo... X%"
- **AND** updates IndexedDB cache with new model
- **AND** confirms: "Modelo actualizado a versión vX"

#### Scenario: Execute inference locally

- **WHEN** operator captures product photo
- **AND** model is loaded (from cache or fresh download)
- **THEN** frontend preprocesses image (resize to 224x224, normalize pixel values)
- **AND** if embeddings exist: extracts MobileNetV2 features and computes cosine similarity against stored embeddings
- **AND** if no embeddings: executes model.predict() on preprocessed image using classifier

- **AND** automatically redirects to manual entry workflow
- **AND** operator can retry model download or proceed with manual entry
- **AND** system remains functional (graceful degradation)

### Requirement: Product Suggestions with Confidence Scores

The system SHALL generate 3-5 product suggestions ordered by confidence score, displaying reference photos, product details, and confidence percentages to assist operator selection.

Inference matching SHALL use `ProductSku` to resolve class predictions to product details, ensuring stability when product names are edited.

#### Scenario: Display suggestions with confidence scores

- **WHEN** inference completes successfully
- **AND** at least one product has score >= threshold (0.70 cosine similarity for embeddings, 40% softmax for classifier)
- **THEN** system displays top 3-5 suggestions ordered by score (highest first)
- **AND** number of suggestions shown depends on how many exceed threshold (variable: 3-5 max)
- **AND** each suggestion shows:
  - Product reference photo (primary ProductPhoto)
  - SKU
  - Product name
  - Score as percentage (e.g., "85%")
- **AND** suggestions are visually distinct (cards or list with photos)
- **AND** operator can select any suggestion by tapping/clicking

#### Scenario: Show 3 suggestions when only 3 exceed threshold

- **WHEN** inference generates exactly 3 products with score >= threshold
- **THEN** system displays exactly 3 suggestions
- **AND** does not show 4th or 5th product if score < threshold

#### Scenario: Show 5 suggestions when many exceed threshold

- **WHEN** inference generates 5 or more products with score >= threshold
- **THEN** system displays top 5 suggestions (capped at 5)
- **AND** does not show 6th product even if score >= threshold

#### Scenario: Show 4 suggestions when 4 exceed threshold

- **WHEN** inference generates exactly 4 products with score >= threshold
- **THEN** system displays exactly 4 suggestions

### Requirement: Confidence Threshold and Fallback

The system SHALL use configurable thresholds to determine when to show suggestions vs redirect to manual entry, ensuring operator only sees reliable suggestions.

For embedding similarity: SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.70 (minimum to include), MIN_TOP_SIMILARITY = 0.50 (minimum for top match to return any result).
For classifier fallback: confidence threshold = 40%.

#### Scenario: Show suggestions when score above threshold

- **WHEN** inference generates at least one product with score >= threshold
- **THEN** system displays suggestions (top 3-5 products >= threshold)
- **AND** operator can select from suggestions or choose "None of these" option

#### Scenario: Redirect to manual entry when all scores below threshold

- **WHEN** inference completes
- **AND** for similarity: top match < 0.50 (MIN_TOP_SIMILARITY)
- **AND** for classifier: ALL products have confidence < 40%
- **THEN** system displays message: "No se encontró una correspondencia fiable"
- **AND** offers options:
  - "Tomar otra foto" (retry image recognition)
  - "Registrar venta manual" (redirect to manual entry with photo preserved)
- **AND** if operator chooses manual entry, captured photo is preserved as optional attachment

#### Scenario: Manual override option

- **WHEN** suggestions are displayed (score >= threshold)
- **THEN** system provides "Ninguno coincide" button

- **AND** new threshold applies to future inferences
- **NOTE**: MVP uses fixed thresholds, configuration deferred to Phase 2

### Requirement: Admin Dashboard for Model Health Monitoring
