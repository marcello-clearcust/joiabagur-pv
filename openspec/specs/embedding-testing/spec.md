# embedding-testing Specification

## Purpose
Defines the automated test requirements for embedding-related backend services, API endpoints, and frontend logic including cosine similarity, inference flow, caching, fallback, and full rebuild.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Backend Unit Tests for Embedding Service

The system SHALL include unit tests for `ImageRecognitionService` embedding methods using Moq for repository mocking, FluentAssertions for assertions, and TestDataGenerator for test data.

#### Scenario: SaveEmbeddingAsync saves new embedding

- **WHEN** `SaveEmbeddingAsync` is called with a valid `SaveEmbeddingRequest` (photoId, productId, sku, 1280-element float array)
- **AND** no embedding exists for that photoId
- **THEN** service calls `IProductPhotoEmbeddingRepository.AddAsync` with a `ProductPhotoEmbedding` entity
- **AND** entity has `ProductPhotoId`, `ProductId`, `ProductSku` matching the request
- **AND** entity has `EmbeddingVector` containing the serialized JSON float array

#### Scenario: SaveEmbeddingAsync upserts existing embedding

- **WHEN** `SaveEmbeddingAsync` is called with a photoId that already has an embedding
- **THEN** service calls `DeleteByPhotoIdAsync` for the existing embedding
- **AND** then calls `AddAsync` with the new embedding data
- **AND** only one embedding per photoId exists after the operation

#### Scenario: SaveEmbeddingAsync rejects invalid vector length

- **WHEN** `SaveEmbeddingAsync` is called with a vector that has fewer or more than 1280 elements
- **THEN** service throws a `DomainException` with message containing "1280"
- **AND** no repository write operations are invoked

#### Scenario: DeleteEmbeddingAsync deletes by photo ID

- **WHEN** `DeleteEmbeddingAsync` is called with a valid photoId
- **THEN** service calls `IProductPhotoEmbeddingRepository.DeleteByPhotoIdAsync(photoId)`

#### Scenario: DeleteAllEmbeddingsAsync clears all embeddings

- **WHEN** `DeleteAllEmbeddingsAsync` is called
- **THEN** service calls `IProductPhotoEmbeddingRepository.DeleteAllAsync()`

#### Scenario: GetAllEmbeddingsAsync returns deserialized embeddings

- **WHEN** `GetAllEmbeddingsAsync` is called
- **AND** repository returns 3 `ProductPhotoEmbedding` records with JSON-serialized vectors
- **THEN** service returns an `EmbeddingsIndexResponse` with 3 `EmbeddingDto` entries
- **AND** each dto has `vector` as a deserialized float array of 1280 elements
- **AND** `count` equals 3
- **AND** `lastUpdated` equals the maximum `UpdatedAt` across all records

#### Scenario: GetAllEmbeddingsAsync returns empty when no embeddings

- **WHEN** `GetAllEmbeddingsAsync` is called
- **AND** repository returns zero records
- **THEN** service returns `EmbeddingsIndexResponse` with empty embeddings list, count = 0, and lastUpdated = null

#### Scenario: GetEmbeddingsStatusAsync returns count and timestamp

- **AND** then sends another POST with a different vector for the same photoId X
- **THEN** GET /api/image-recognition/embeddings returns only one embedding for photoId X
- **AND** the vector matches the second POST (most recent)

#### Scenario: DELETE single embedding removes only that embedding

- **WHEN** authenticated client saves two embeddings (photoId A, photoId B)
- **AND** sends DELETE /api/image-recognition/embeddings/{photoIdA}
- **THEN** response status is 204 No Content

- **THEN** response status is 401 Unauthorized

### Requirement: Frontend Unit Tests for Cosine Similarity Function

The system SHALL include unit tests for the `cosineSimilarity` function verifying mathematical correctness and edge cases.

#### Scenario: Identical vectors return similarity of 1.0

- **WHEN** `cosineSimilarity` is called with two identical Float32Arrays
- **THEN** the result is 1.0 (within floating-point tolerance of 1e-6)

#### Scenario: Orthogonal vectors return similarity of 0.0

- **WHEN** `cosineSimilarity` is called with two orthogonal Float32Arrays (e.g., [1,0,...] and [0,1,...])
- **THEN** the result is 0.0 (within floating-point tolerance of 1e-6)

#### Scenario: Opposite vectors return similarity of -1.0

- **WHEN** `cosineSimilarity` is called with a vector and its negation

- **THEN** result contains SKU01 first (0.95), SKU02 second (0.80)
- **AND** SKU03 is excluded (below 0.70 threshold)
- **AND** result has at most 5 entries

#### Scenario: Uses max similarity per product across multiple photos

- **WHEN** product SKU01 has two photos with similarities 0.60 and 0.85 to the query
- **THEN** SKU01 appears in results with similarity 0.85 (the max)

#### Scenario: Returns empty when top match below MIN_TOP_SIMILARITY

- **WHEN** all products have similarity < 0.50 to the query
- **THEN** result is an empty array

#### Scenario: Returns partial results when few exceed threshold

- **THEN** result contains only the 2 products above 0.70

### Requirement: Frontend Unit Tests for Embeddings Index Caching

The system SHALL include unit tests for `loadEmbeddingsIndex` verifying caching behavior and staleness detection.

- **AND** `recognizeProductByClassifier` is NOT called

#### Scenario: Uses classifier path when no embeddings exist

- **WHEN** `recognizeProduct` is called
- **AND** `getEmbeddingsStatus()` returns count = 0
- **THEN** `recognizeProductByClassifier` is called
- **AND** `recognizeProductBySimilarity` is NOT called

#### Scenario: Falls back to classifier on similarity error

- **WHEN** `recognizeProduct` is called
- **AND** `getEmbeddingsStatus()` returns count > 0
- **AND** `recognizeProductBySimilarity` throws an error
- **THEN** `recognizeProductByClassifier` is called as fallback
- **AND** error is logged as warning

### Requirement: Frontend Unit Tests for Embedding Generation

- **THEN** `deleteAllEmbeddings()` is called first
- **AND** MobileNetV2 feature extractor is loaded
- **AND** each photo is processed (download, preprocess, extract, save)
- **AND** progress callback is called with incrementing counts (1/3, 2/3, 3/3)
- **AND** `saveEmbedding` is called 3 times with correct photoId, productId, sku, and 1280-dim vectors

#### Scenario: Full rebuild skips failed photos and continues

- **WHEN** `executeEmbeddingGeneration` is called
- **AND** photo 2 of 3 fails to download
- **THEN** photos 1 and 3 are processed successfully
- **AND** `saveEmbedding` is called 2 times
- **AND** progress reports reflect the failure
