# frontend-testing Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change setup-frontend-testing. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Unit Test Infrastructure

The frontend SHALL provide a unit testing infrastructure using Vitest that enables developers to write and run isolated tests for utilities, hooks, and pure functions.

#### Scenario: Run unit tests

- **WHEN** a developer executes `npm run test`
- **THEN** Vitest runs all test files matching `**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}`
- **AND** results are displayed in the terminal with pass/fail status

#### Scenario: Watch mode for development

- **WHEN** a developer executes `npm run test:watch`
- **THEN** Vitest runs in watch mode
- **AND** re-runs affected tests when source files change

#### Scenario: Coverage reporting

- **WHEN** a developer executes `npm run test:coverage`
- **THEN** Vitest generates a coverage report
- **AND** reports are available in text, HTML, and lcov formats
- **AND** the minimum coverage target is 70%

---

### Requirement: Component Test Infrastructure

The frontend SHALL provide component testing capabilities using React Testing Library that enables testing React components with user-centric queries and interactions.

#### Scenario: Render components with providers

- **WHEN** a test uses the custom `render()` utility from `src/test/utils/render.tsx`
- **THEN** the component is wrapped with all required providers (AuthProvider, Router, ThemeProvider, etc.)
- **AND** the test can query elements using accessible queries (getByRole, getByLabelText)
- **AND** the custom render utility exports a function that extends React Testing Library's render with provider wrappers

#### Scenario: Simulate user interactions

- **WHEN** a test uses `userEvent` from @testing-library/user-event
- **THEN** user interactions (click, type, select) behave like real user actions
- **AND** async state updates are properly awaited
- **AND** userEvent is initialized with `userEvent.setup()` before interactions

#### Scenario: Test form validation

- **WHEN** a test submits a form with React Hook Form and Zod validation
- **THEN** validation errors are accessible via screen queries
- **AND** the test can verify form submission behavior
- **AND** form validation errors are tested using accessible queries (getByRole with error role or getByText for error messages)

---

### Requirement: API Mocking Infrastructure

The frontend SHALL provide API mocking capabilities using MSW (Mock Service Worker) that enables testing components that depend on API calls without hitting real endpoints.

#### Scenario: Mock API responses

- **WHEN** a component makes an API request during a test
- **THEN** MSW intercepts the request
- **AND** returns a mocked response defined in handlers

#### Scenario: Test error scenarios

- **WHEN** a test needs to verify error handling behavior
- **THEN** the test can override handlers to return error responses (401, 500, etc.)
- **AND** error states are properly rendered

#### Scenario: Reset handlers between tests

- **WHEN** a test modifies handlers for a specific scenario
- **THEN** handlers are reset to default state after the test completes
- **AND** subsequent tests are not affected

---

### Requirement: End-to-End Test Infrastructure

The frontend SHALL provide E2E testing capabilities using Playwright that enables testing complete user flows across multiple pages and interactions.

#### Scenario: Run E2E tests

- **WHEN** a developer executes `npm run test:e2e`
- **THEN** Playwright runs all E2E tests in `e2e/` directory
- **AND** tests run in Chromium browser by default

#### Scenario: E2E with UI mode

- **WHEN** a developer executes `npm run test:e2e:ui`
- **THEN** Playwright opens interactive UI mode
- **AND** developers can step through tests and debug failures

#### Scenario: Multi-browser testing

- **WHEN** E2E tests run in CI
- **THEN** tests can be configured to run in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **AND** failures in any browser are reported

---

### Requirement: Test Conventions

The frontend testing infrastructure SHALL enforce consistent conventions for test organization, naming, query priority, and structure patterns.

#### Scenario: Colocated test files

- **WHEN** a developer creates a test for a component, hook, or utility
- **THEN** the test file is placed next to the source file
- **AND** the test file uses the naming pattern `{name}.test.{ts,tsx}`
- **AND** test files are excluded from production builds via Vitest configuration

#### Scenario: Descriptive test names

- **WHEN** a developer writes a test
- **THEN** the test description follows the pattern `should [behavior] when [condition]`
- **AND** tests are organized in `describe` blocks by component/function name
- **AND** test descriptions clearly express the expected behavior and conditions

#### Scenario: Accessible queries prioritized

- **WHEN** a component test queries the DOM
- **THEN** queries follow the priority order: getByRole, getByLabelText, getByPlaceholderText, getByText, getByDisplayValue, getByAltText, getByTitle, getByTestId
- **AND** getByTestId is used only as a last resort when no accessible query is available
- **AND** tests prioritize queries that reflect how users interact with the application

#### Scenario: AAA test structure pattern

- **WHEN** a developer writes a test
- **THEN** the test follows the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- **AND** the Arrange section prepares test data and renders components
- **AND** the Act section executes user interactions or function calls
- **AND** the Assert section verifies expected outcomes
- **AND** comments clearly separate each section when needed for readability

---

### Requirement: Test Utilities Structure

The frontend SHALL provide a structured test utilities directory (`src/test/utils/`) that contains reusable testing helpers and utilities.

#### Scenario: Custom render utility

- **WHEN** a test imports the custom render utility from `src/test/utils/render.tsx`
- **THEN** the utility wraps React Testing Library's render function
- **AND** automatically provides all required context providers (AuthProvider, Router, ThemeProvider)
- **AND** accepts optional overrides for provider values
- **AND** returns the same API as React Testing Library's render function

#### Scenario: Test data factories

- **WHEN** a test needs test data for entities (Product, User, Sale, etc.)
- **THEN** the test imports factory functions from `src/test/utils/test-data.ts`
- **AND** factory functions accept optional overrides to customize generated data
- **AND** factory functions generate realistic test data with required fields populated
- **AND** factories support builder patterns for complex test scenarios

#### Scenario: Test utilities organization

- **WHEN** a developer needs test utilities
- **THEN** utilities are organized in `src/test/utils/` directory
- **AND** `render.tsx` contains the custom render function
- **AND** `test-data.ts` contains factory functions for test data generation
- **AND** `index.ts` exports all utilities for convenient importing

### Requirement: Test Documentation Structure

The frontend testing infrastructure SHALL maintain comprehensive documentation organized in `Documentos/Testing/Frontend/` that guides developers through testing practices.

### Requirement: MSW Server Configuration
