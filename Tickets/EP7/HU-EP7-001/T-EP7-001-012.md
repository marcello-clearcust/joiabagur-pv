# T-EP7-001-012: Implement component tests for LoginPage

## Purpose

Create React Testing Library tests for the LoginPage component to ensure the UI behaves correctly, form validation works, and user interactions are properly handled.

## Details

### Test Scenarios
- **Form rendering**: Should display username and password fields
- **Form validation**: Should show errors for empty required fields
- **Form submission**: Should call auth service on valid form submission
- **Loading states**: Should show loading indicator during authentication
- **Error display**: Should display authentication errors to user
- **Accessibility**: Should use proper ARIA labels and roles
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Should work properly on different screen sizes

### Testing Approach
- Use React Testing Library with Vitest
- Test user interactions (typing, clicking, form submission)
- Use `getByRole` and `getByLabelText` for accessible queries
- Mock AuthService and router for isolation
- Test component with different props and states

### Form Testing
- Test username field validation and input
- Test password field with show/hide functionality
- Test form submission with Enter key
- Test form submission with button click
- Test form validation before submission

### User Experience Testing
- Test loading states during API calls
- Test error message display and clearing
- Test form state preservation on errors
- Test accessibility compliance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Loading and error states are tested
