# payment-method-management Specification

## Purpose

Enable configuration and management of payment methods across the multi-location retail system. Payment methods can be assigned to specific points of sale and are validated during sales transactions. This capability supports flexible payment processing and ensures only authorized payment methods are used at each location.

**Integration Points:**
- Integrates with `point-of-sale-management` for payment method assignments
- Integrates with `access-control` for role-based permissions (Admin only)
- Will integrate with future `sales-registration` (EP3) for payment validation

**Deferred Integrations:** See `openspec/DEFERRED_TASKS.md` for EP3 integration tasks.

### Requirement: Point of Sale Payment Method Management

The system SHALL manage payment method availability per point of sale.

#### Scenario: View assigned payment methods

- **WHEN** admin views payment methods for specific point of sale
- **THEN** system returns assigned payment methods with active status
- **AND** includes payment method details (code, name, description)

#### Scenario: Activate payment method assignment

- **WHEN** admin activates inactive assignment
- **THEN** system sets IsActive to true
- **AND** clears DeactivatedAt timestamp
- **AND** payment method becomes available for sales

#### Scenario: Deactivate payment method assignment

- **WHEN** admin deactivates active assignment
- **THEN** system sets IsActive to false
- **AND** sets DeactivatedAt timestamp
- **AND** payment method is no longer available for new sales

#### Scenario: Unassign payment method

- **WHEN** admin completely removes payment method assignment
- **THEN** system deletes PointOfSalePaymentMethod record
- **AND** payment method is no longer associated with point of sale

### Requirement: Sales Payment Method Validation

The system SHALL validate payment methods during sales transactions.

#### Scenario: Validate payment method availability

- **WHEN** sale is created with payment method and point of sale
- **THEN** system validates payment method is assigned and active for that point of sale
- **AND** allows sale if validation passes

#### Scenario: Reject sale with unavailable payment method

- **WHEN** sale is created with payment method not available at point of sale
- **THEN** system returns 400 Bad Request
- **AND** provides message "El método de pago no está disponible en este punto de venta"

#### Scenario: Allow sale with available payment method

- **WHEN** sale is created with payment method that is active and assigned
- **THEN** system processes sale successfully
- **AND** creates sale record with payment method reference

### Requirement: Authorization Controls

The system SHALL enforce role-based access to payment method operations.

#### Scenario: Admin full access

- **WHEN** authenticated admin performs any payment method operation
- **THEN** system allows operation without restrictions

#### Scenario: Operator restricted access

- **WHEN** operator attempts payment method management operations
- **THEN** system returns 403 Forbidden
- **AND** provides message "Acceso denegado"

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated access

- **WHEN** unauthenticated user accesses payment method endpoints
- **THEN** system returns 401 Unauthorized

### Requirement: Data Integrity and Business Rules

The system SHALL maintain data integrity for payment method operations.

#### Scenario: Prevent deactivation with active sales

- **WHEN** admin attempts to deactivate payment method assignment with recent sales

- **THEN** system may optionally deactivate all payment method assignments
- **AND** prevents new assignments to deactivated point of sale

### Requirement: Seed Data Management

The system SHALL provide predefined payment methods on initialization.

#### Scenario: Automatic seed data
