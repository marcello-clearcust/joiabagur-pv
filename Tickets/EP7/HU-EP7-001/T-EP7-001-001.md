# T-EP7-001-001: Implement User domain entity and authentication interfaces

## Purpose

Create the domain foundation for user authentication by implementing the User entity with all required properties and interfaces for authentication services. This ticket establishes the core domain model that will be used throughout the authentication system.

## Details

### User Entity Requirements
- Implement User entity according to `Documentos/modelo-de-datos.md`
- Include all authentication-related fields: Username, PasswordHash, Role, IsActive, LastLoginAt
- Add validation rules and business logic methods
- Implement role-based access control enums (Admin, Operator)

### Authentication Interfaces
- Define IAuthenticationService interface for authentication operations
- Define IUserRepository interface for user data access
- Define IJwtService interface for JWT token generation and validation
- Include method signatures for login, token validation, and user retrieval

### Domain Constraints
- Username must be unique and immutable after creation
- Password must be stored as BCrypt hash (never plain text)
- Role-based permissions (Admin vs Operator)
- User activation/deactivation logic

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User entity is created with all required properties matching the data model
- [ ] Authentication interfaces are defined with proper method signatures
- [ ] Domain validation rules are implemented (unique username, required fields)
- [ ] Entity Framework Core annotations are added for database mapping
- [ ] Unit tests can be created for domain logic

## Priority
High

## Estimation
3 SP
