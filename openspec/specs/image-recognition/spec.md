## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-sales-and-image-recognition. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Client-Side ML Inference

The system SHALL execute machine learning inference in the browser/mobile device using TensorFlow.js, eliminating server-side ML costs and reducing latency for product identification.
