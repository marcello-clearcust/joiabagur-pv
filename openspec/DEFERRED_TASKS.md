# OpenSpec Deferred Tasks

This document tracks all tasks that have been deferred to future phases or epics, along with explanations for why they were deferred.

## Active Change: `add-sales-and-image-recognition`

### Phase 2 - Offline Capabilities (Image Recognition)

**Status:** Documented in specs but NOT implemented in MVP

**Deferred Tasks:**
1. **Offline model usage** - Cached model when no network connection
2. **Progressive Web App offline capabilities** - Full offline support for PWA
3. **Push notifications for new model versions** - Notify users when new model is available
4. **IndexedDB model caching** - Store model locally for offline inference
5. **Offline inference execution** - Run ML inference without network connectivity
6. **Background model updates** - Download new models in background during idle time
7. **Cache invalidation logic** - Manage cached model version lifecycle

**Why Deferred:**
- MVP focuses on core online functionality
- Offline scenarios add significant complexity (state management, cache invalidation, conflict resolution)
- Network connectivity is expected in retail POS environments
- Simplifies MVP UX and reduces development time
- Can be added incrementally without breaking existing functionality

**Reference:** `openspec/changes/add-sales-and-image-recognition/proposal.md` lines 63-69

### Phase 2 - Model Configuration & Analytics

**Deferred Tasks:**
1. **Configurable confidence threshold** - Admin UI to adjust threshold (20%-80% range)
   - Currently fixed at 40% in MVP
   - **Why:** Need real-world usage data to determine optimal threshold before making it configurable

2. **Precision metrics calculation** - Track model accuracy over time
   - Currently returns `null` in MVP
   - **Why:** Requires inference logging infrastructure and historical data collection

3. **Analytics logging** - Log inference metrics (inference time, confidence scores)
   - Optional in MVP
   - **Why:** Not critical for MVP functionality, adds storage/complexity

4. **AIInferenceLog table** - Store inference history for analytics
   - **Why:** Requires database schema changes and logging infrastructure

**Reference:** 
- `openspec/changes/add-sales-and-image-recognition/specs/image-recognition/spec.md` lines 165, 437
- `openspec/changes/add-sales-and-image-recognition/tasks.md` lines 140, 235, 260

### Phase 2 - Model Retraining Automation

**Deferred Tasks:**
1. **Automatic model retraining triggers** - Retrain when products added/removed or photos updated
   - Currently manual trigger via admin endpoint
   - **Why:** Adds complexity (monitoring, failure handling, cost control). Manual retraining sufficient for MVP with ~500 products

2. **Scheduled retraining** - Nightly retraining if photos changed in last 24h
   - **Why:** Unnecessary for MVP scale, adds infrastructure complexity

3. **Incremental learning** - Add new products without full retrain
   - **Why:** Advanced ML technique, not needed for MVP scale

4. **A/B testing with version pinning** - Deploy new model to subset of users
   - **Why:** Over-engineering for MVP, adds significant complexity

**Reference:** 
- `openspec/changes/add-sales-and-image-recognition/design.md` lines 81, 265-268, 658

### Phase 2 - Frontend Enhancements

**Deferred Tasks:**
1. **CSV export for sales history** - Download sales data as CSV
   - **Why:** Nice-to-have feature, not critical for MVP

2. **Progressive model download** - Download model in chunks/streaming
   - **Why:** Simplifies MVP UX, adds state complexity. Current approach (full download) acceptable for ~14MB model

**Reference:** 
- `openspec/changes/add-sales-and-image-recognition/tasks.md` lines 248, 623

## Archived Changes - EP3 Integration Tasks

### Payment Method Management - Sales Integration

**Status:** Deferred until EP3 (Sales Registration) is implemented

**Deferred Tasks:**
1. **Integrate validation into sale creation workflow** - Use payment method validation when creating sales
2. **Return appropriate error messages for invalid payment methods** - Sales-specific error handling
3. **Prevent deactivation of payment methods assigned to active sales** - Business rule enforcement
4. **Test sales validation with payment methods** - Integration tests
5. **Test sales creation with valid/invalid payment methods** - End-to-end tests
6. **Sales validation documentation** - API documentation updates

**Why Deferred:**
- These tasks require the sales system (EP3) to be implemented first
- Payment method management was built as standalone capability
- Integration will be completed when sales registration is implemented
- **Note:** Sales registration is now being implemented in `add-sales-and-image-recognition` change

**Reference:** 
- `openspec/changes/archive/2026-01-07-add-payment-method-management/tasks.md` lines 46-47, 56, 74, 78, 108, 114

## Archived Changes - Documentation Tasks

### Point of Sale Management - System Documentation

**Status:** Deferred to post-MVP documentation phase

**Deferred Tasks:**
1. **Update data model documentation** - Full ERD and schema documentation
2. **Update architectural diagrams** - C4 model updates, sequence diagrams

**Why Deferred:**
- Documentation tasks are non-functional requirements
- Can be completed after MVP is stable
- Focus on implementation over documentation for MVP phase

**Reference:** 
- `openspec/changes/archive/2026-01-07-add-point-of-sale-management/tasks.md` lines 76-77
- `openspec/changes/archive/2025-12-14-add-point-of-sale-management/tasks.md` lines 76-77

### Payment Method Management - Documentation

**Deferred Tasks:**
1. **Update data model documentation** - Full ERD updates
2. **Sales validation documentation** - Integration documentation (requires EP3)

**Why Deferred:**
- Same rationale as POS management documentation
- Sales validation docs require EP3 implementation

**Reference:** 
- `openspec/changes/archive/2026-01-07-add-payment-method-management/tasks.md` lines 106, 108

## Archived Changes - Testing Tasks

### Product Catalog Search - Integration Tests

**Status:** Deferred (lower priority)

**Deferred Tasks:**
1. **Integration tests for GET /api/products** - Pagination, sorting, filtering
2. **Integration tests for GET /api/products/search** - Role-based filtering
3. **Integration tests for DELETE /api/products/{id}/photos/{photoId}** - Admin-only endpoint
4. **Integration tests for PUT photo management endpoints** - Admin-only endpoints

**Why Deferred:**
- Lower priority compared to unit tests and critical path integration tests
- Functionality is covered by unit tests and manual testing
- Can be added incrementally

**Reference:** 
- `openspec/changes/archive/2026-01-08-extend-product-catalog-search/tasks.md` lines 97-100

## Implementation Guidance

When implementing deferred tasks:

1. **Check this document** - Ensure task is still relevant and not superseded
2. **Review original spec** - Check `openspec/changes/[change-id]/specs/` for full requirements
3. **Review design decisions** - Check `openspec/changes/[change-id]/design.md` for context
4. **Create new change proposal** - If adding new capability, create new change proposal
5. **Update this document** - Mark tasks as completed or update status
